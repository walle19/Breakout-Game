# Breakout-Game

# Description
In the Breakout game, a ball travels across the screen, bouncing off the top and side walls of the screen. Bricks
are tiled in layers at the top the screen and when the ball hits a brick, it bounces away and the brick is
destroyed. The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen. To prevent this, the player
displaces horizontally a paddle to bounce the ball upwards, keeping it in play.
Player will have three turns (lifelines) and in case all lifelines are used then player loses the game. In case, all
bricks are destroyed then the game is over. Settings of game are provided in which player can update the
speed of ball, number of balls, length of paddle and switch on/off the background music.
